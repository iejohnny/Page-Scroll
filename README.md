Page Scroll
===========

Hello Friend,

After spending a couple of weeks trying to get a jQuery easy page scrolling script that would work on iPads, and iPhones I decided to combine a few of them to create this one.

Please use http://gsgd.co.uk/sandbox/jquery/easing/ for awesome easing!

Thanks

Just updated it with an example. 

Enjoy
